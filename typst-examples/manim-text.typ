  `You're right, but "Genshin Impact" is a brand-new open-world adventure game independently developed by miHoYo. The game takes place in a fantasy world called "Teyvat," where those chosen by the gods are granted "Visions" to channel elemental powers. You will play as a mysterious character called the "Traveler," encountering companions with diverse personalities and unique abilities during your free journey. Together with them, you'll defeat powerful enemies and search for your lost siblingâ€”while gradually uncovering the truth behind "Genshin Impact."
